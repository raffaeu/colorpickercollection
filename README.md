###Welcome to ColorPicker for Android
This project is a fork of the original [Color Picker Collection](https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/colorpickercollection) 
which unfortunately does not work with Android Studio and neither with the latest version of Android SDK.
So, as usual, I decided to own the project and re-write it in order to make it consumable from Android Studio and Maven.

##Structure of the project
*ColorPicker* provides three major components:
 - ColorPickerDialog
 - ColorPickerCollection
 - ColorPickerPreference
